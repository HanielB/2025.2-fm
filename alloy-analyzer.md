# Installing the Analyzer

The Alloy Analyzer 6 is available [here](https://alloytools.org/download.html)
(the `latest` build) as a jar file and requires that Java to be installed on
your machine.

The easiest way to install the tool is simply to download the [`org.alloytools.alloy.dist.jar`](https://github.com/AlloyTools/org.alloytools.alloy/releases/download/v6.2.0/org.alloytools.alloy.dist.jar) file onto your Desktop and then launch it either by double clicking on its icon (Windows or Mac) or right-clicking the icon and then choosing "Open With java" (Linux).
